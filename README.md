# Who Wants To Be A Millionaire

This game was created using python and the Tkinter library, and it's the famous game who wants to be a millionaire, but
I made the phone button works in a different way, because I could not find any library that could read the arabic
questions and answer, so I imported a library in python and I set the language to ar, and then I made it read the answer,
and then save it in a file and then read it using any media player, and after that I imported the OS module in python to
control the processof the media player and made the system sleep using the sleep() function for a couple of seconds,
until the answer is read, then I used the OS module to terminate the process using the TASKKILL command.

And here is a couple images from the game:
